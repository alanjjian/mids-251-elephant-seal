Notes about the data:
We did not use some tiles from the following full images because they included California Sea Lions in addition to Northern Elephant Seals: 
`4MSL0107`, `4MSL0118`, `4MSL0089`, `4MSL0093`, `4MSL0094`, `4MSL0095`, `5MSL0009`, `5MSL0010`, `5MSL0011`, `5MSL0012`, `5MSL0013`, `5MSL0014`, `5MSL0048`, `5MSL0067`, `5MSL0068`, `5MSL0084`, `5MSL0085`, `5MSL3902`, and `5MSL3903`.
